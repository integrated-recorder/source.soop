# SOOP Native Grid — Streamlink Plugin

[한국어](README.md) | **English**

An external Python plugin that receives SOOP Native Grid broadcasts through Streamlink. It uses Streamlink's public plugin API and outputs H.264/AAC as MPEG-TS without re-encoding. It does not require a SOOP Grid Agent or a Go executable.

## Status

This remains an **Experimental/Beta** plugin; Stable Candidate validation is complete, but no Stable release is being declared. Bundle `30ea7bd2…` passed source-matched 600-second A/V validation, a 7,200.986-second Grid-only run, two-hour event comparison, and three controlled Parent socket-close recoveries through the actual StreamIO consumer/EOF/drain path on Linux, Python 3.12, and Streamlink 8.6.2. The [Stable Candidate report](docs/STABLE_CANDIDATE_VALIDATION.md) records measurements and scope. Natural server failures, total Internet outage, every broadcast/codec configuration, perceptual lip-sync on arbitrary content, and Cyneti co-viewing compatibility remain unverified.

## Features

- Native TCP Grid reception without the Windows Grid Agent
- Streamlink output to files and other supported Streamlink targets
- H.264/AAC preserved and muxed into MPEG-TS without transcoding
- Grid-first `auto` by default, Grid-only `grid`, and built-in SOOP HLS delegation with `hls`
- Restricted HLS fallback for allowlisted initial transport failures
- Single-Parent reception with bounded Center rediscovery and Cache-overlap recovery
- One-file installation without installing a project Python package

## Requirements

- Streamlink 8.6.2 recommended (tested on Linux with Python 3.12.3)
- Streamlink's normal dependencies
- Enough disk space for the recording

No project package, Go, FFmpeg receive process, SOOP Agent, or VPN is required. FFmpeg is optional for post-recording inspection only. Installation paths are documented for Windows and macOS, but runtime operation has not been verified on those systems.

## Install

Save the repository artifact `dist/soop_grid.py` in Streamlink's user plugin directory as **`soop_grid.py`**. Streamlink loads it with the external plugin ID `soop_grid`; the built-in `soop` plugin remains available.

See the [Korean user guide](docs/COMMUNITY_GUIDE_KO.md) for platform-specific paths, discovery checks, updates, and removal. For a reproducible installation, use a download URL pinned to the published release commit.

## Record a stream

After installation, and only for a broadcast you are authorized to watch and record:

```sh
streamlink 'https://play.sooplive.com/CHANNEL_ID/BNO' original -o recording.ts
```

When omitted, the transport option defaults to `auto`, which tries Native Grid first.

## Grid / HLS / Auto

| Mode | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Default or `auto` | Grid first; try official HLS only for allowlisted initial transport failures before media output |
| `grid` | Native Grid only; no HLS transition |
| `hls` | Delegate to Streamlink's built-in `soop` plugin |

`auto` does not fall back on authorization denial, malformed protocol/media, or frame-continuity errors. After Grid output begins, it does not append HLS bytes or mix the two timelines. See the [user guide](docs/COMMUNITY_GUIDE_KO.md) for commands and details.

## Key limitations

- Stable Candidate measurements are limited to the [validation report](docs/STABLE_CANDIDATE_VALIDATION.md). Grid composition PTS and real-time POC/PTS contradiction checks remain enabled; unsupported H.264 structures still fail closed. Older reports remain revision-specific historical records and are not counted as results from the latest bundle.
- An earlier 121-second wall-clock Pilot B still ended with `media_track_coverage_incomplete`. Its roughly 517 ms final audio/video boundary remains unexplained because packet-arrival timestamps were not recorded; later window and endurance passes do not reclassify that run as complete.
- The 600-second and two-hour measurements use deterministic source-relative A/V test events. They do not prove perceptual synchronization for arbitrary program content or guarantee lossless operation for every failure.
- Automatic account reauthentication, reliable classification of broadcast end versus network failure, and automatic broadcast-number changes are not supported.
- H.264 POC types 0/1/2 are supported for validated progressive/Grid-composition subsets. Live Type-1 validation is limited to a no-reorder sample; Grid MMCO 5 remains fail-closed. See the [POC support matrix](docs/POC_TYPE_SUPPORT_MATRIX.md) for offline and self-broadcast evidence and boundaries. ADTS AAC support is also limited to validated configurations. Simultaneous multi-Parent reception is not supported.
- Native Grid exposes only the profiles advertised for a broadcast and backed by measurements. The currently measured profiles are `original`, `1080p`, `720p`, `540p`, and `360p`; 1080p is currently exposed only for a 1440p original, and a broadcast may offer fewer. The receiver checks both the Parent quality and H.264 SPS height before emitting output and fails closed on mismatch. `best` and `worst` select among the exposed profiles. A 2160p-to-1080p Grid profile is not verified. See [Native Grid quality validation](docs/NATIVE_GRID_QUALITY_SELECTION.md). HLS retains the quality list from the built-in `soop` plugin.
- If Cache overlap and continuity cannot be verified, reception fails rather than inventing data. Three seconds without media may trigger recovery.
- Optional raw diagnostic capture can consume substantial disk space and synchronous I/O. It is disabled by default.
- Windows/macOS runtime, all broadcast conditions, and long-run A/V drift have not been verified.
- For authentication, use the external plugin options `--soop-grid-username`, `--soop-grid-password`, and `--soop-grid-stream-password`, or `SOOP_GRID_USERNAME`, `SOOP_GRID_PASSWORD`, and `SOOP_GRID_STREAM_PASSWORD`. The previous recorder variables `SOOP_ACCOUNT_ID`, `SOOP_ACCOUNT_PASSWORD`, and `SOOP_STREAM_PASSWORD` remain compatibility aliases. Built-in `--soop-*` options are not passed to the external plugin. A broadcast password without an account can be delegated to the built-in plugin with `--soop-grid-transport hls`; accountless broadcast-password use is unsupported for Grid and Auto.

This Streamlink plugin is separate from the Go-based Integrated Recorder Source Adapter in the same repository. It is not integrated into the production Adapter or Core. The repository root README describes the Go Adapter.

## License

The plugin and generated distribution artifact are licensed **AGPL-3.0-only**. See [LICENSE](LICENSE). Users are responsible for respecting broadcast access permissions, recording rights, and SOOP's terms.

See [Grid composition timing validation](docs/GRID_COMPOSITION_TIMING.md) for the current model. New-model live endurance and perceptual A/V sync remain unverified.

The production H.264 clock requires explicit Grid composition. Historical HRD/no-reorder timing comparisons live in the [offline audit tool](docs/LEGACY_HRD_AUDIT.md), excluded from the distributed bundle. Real-time POC–PTS validation remains enabled.

## Bounded startup retry (experimental, disabled by default)

Enable with `--soop-grid-startup-retries 1` or `2`; `--soop-grid-startup-window 2` selects a validation window from 0.5 to 8 seconds. This feature is outside the long-run validation of the historical `30ea7bd2…` Stable Candidate bundle.

Only an initial Cache `frame_sequence_gap_or_reset` before publication is eligible. Identity, authorization and codec errors remain terminal. Committed recordings never restart sessions. This abandons a failed unpublished starting session; it does not recover missing media. Staging is capped at 32MiB, each startup attempt at 15 seconds, total startup at 45 seconds and extra attempts at two. Opt-in duration/input-byte budgets include failed attempts. Raw capture with retry is explicitly unsupported. See [STARTUP_RETRY.md](docs/STARTUP_RETRY.md).

No naturally failing live session subsequently succeeded through retry in the current small sample. Default enablement and Stable promotion remain withheld.
